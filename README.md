# ðŸ§ŠSolana Freeze BundlerðŸ§Š

Solana Freeze Bundler is a script that deploys a token on the Solana blockchain. It bundles snipes on block 0 and automatically blacklists/freezes addresses after a swap is detected!

It will only allow the initial snipes to sell, while any other address will be frozen.

This can be useful for managing token security and preventing malicious activities!
